           <p> Hello, <strong>my</strong> name is Hannah Selsor. This is my second year doing my masters in Educational Technology. <br>After I finish my<strong> masters</strong> in the spring I plan to go on and get my <em>Math Specialist</em> Certification. I teach 4th and 5th grade Math and this year I will also be helping with 5th and 6th grade band. I have previously taught 4th grade music. This year is my 7th year of teaching. I spend most of my time either working on work or school. However, in my free time I enjoy playing games, cooking, hiking, fishing, and watching crime shows. One of my favorite non crime shows is Doctor Who. I enjoy all types of cooking, but making desserts are my favorite. Some of my favorite games are Nertz, Uno, Yahtzee, and Sorry. My husband and I got married about a year and a half ago. We currently live in Moberly, MO. My husband works at a TV news station in Columbia, MO.
